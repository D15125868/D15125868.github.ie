	<p>The RMS Leinster was the mail boat from Holyhead to Dun Laoghaire during World War I. The RMS Leinster 
	belonged to the City of Dublin Steam Packet Company. It carried passengers and mail between Ireland and Wales. 
	The Leinster was attacked by the German submarine UB-123 on October 10th, 1918 off Kish Bank. It was carrying 
	771 passengers, about 400 of these would have been soldiers bound for England and the Continent. The ship was 
	torpedoed twice, three minutes apart. The first torpedo struck the post office quarters, killing all but one 
	of the post office staff. In total there were only 256 people rescued, most of the survivors being taken to 
	hospital in Dun Laoghaire. This represents one of Dublinâ€™s greatest maritime tragedies. The Leinster lies 
	approximately 22km west of Dun Laoghaire with her bow pointing south. The bow stands proud of the seabed, 
	a little apart from the rest of the wreck, which hass largely collapsed and settling into the sands. </p>
